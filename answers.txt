What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge attempts to merge two different versions of a file together and shows you the errors to manually fix.
A rebase changes the base of a branch to a specified commit in that branch. So if you dont need commits 1 and 2 to a branch, you can make commit 3 the new head.
